Proof of work is an attractive conensus protocol for cryptocurrencies that aspire to become meaningful stores of value.

## Universal access

The most common way people obtain cryptocurrency is through fiat purchases. One must connect their bank account to a cryptocurrency exchange, transfer fiat money to the exchange, and then purchase cryptocurrency. This poses multiple problems, including requiring access to a bank account and giving up some privacy.

Proof of work mining systems afford the ability to convert real-world wealth into cryptocurrency in a straightforward way, via energy consumption. As far as I know, this is the only concrete way of transferring real-world wealth into cryptocurrency without depending on exchange rates and fiat on-ramps.


## Value peg

If the price of a Bitcoin goes below the cost of mining a Bitcoin, a drop in hash rate and subsequent difficulty adjustment(s) ensure that it remains economical to mine. Assuming a cryptoeconomy exists, and people are accepting Bitcoin for goods and services, proof of work remains a useful way to convert real-world wealth into wealth that may be stored and spent with a relatively higher degree of privacy and flexibility.


## Common objections

**Environmental impact**: the environmental impact of proof of work is wasteful.

As a species, our energy consumption has risen tremendously as we develop new technologies, on a large timescale. Bitcoin mining is an incredibly trivial contributor to global energy consumption. Environmental impact of energy consumption is a significant problem, but solutions lie in technical advances in clean energy production; we will continue to consume significantly more energy in the long run. In short, moving Bitcoin to a “low-energy” consensus protocol does next to nothing for the environment.

**ASIC-based miner domination**: ASIC-based miners centralize mining to those that can manufacture and access ASIC-based mining hardware.

This argument is more compelling, because a limitation on ASIC-based mining hardware introduces inequality in Bitcoin access. ASIC-based mining hardware is indeed generally accessible though, and unlike a direct fiat-onramp, the fiat you used to purchase mining hardware and subsequently mine Bitcoin does not compromise your privacy. ASIC-based mining hardware also ensures a good use of scarce natural resources.

*Note: Although some take issue with the use of the words “cryptocurrency” and “cryptoeconomy”, I use them because the terms are widely understood and accepted.*
